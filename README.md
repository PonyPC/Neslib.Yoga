# Neslib.Yoga - Delphi version of Yoga Layout

This is a Delphi version of the [Yoga Layout Engine](https://yogalayout.com/) by Facebook Open Source.

## Getting Started

To get started, try out the `YogaPlayground` project.

Other usage samples can be found in the units tests project `YogaTests`.

## Configuration

Some behavior can be customized with a couple of conditional defines. See the top of the `Neslib.Yoga` unit for information about these defines, as well as some details about the differences compared to the original C++ versions, and some ideas for optimizations.

## Documentation

The `Neslib.Yoga` API is very similar to the original C++ API and its derived JavaScript, Java and C# APIs. So the [official documentation](https://yogalayout.com/docs) should answer most questions. 

For additional information, look at the playground project and unit tests.

## Version

The Delphi version is based on [version 1.10.0](https://github.com/facebook/yoga/releases/tag/1.10.0) of the original version.
